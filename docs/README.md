# Additional Documentation

This folder contains a few additional documents that outgrew what conveniently fits on the wiki.

- [KB-file-formats.doc](KB-file-formats.doc) provides a detailed reference of what goes into a Knowledge Base (aka [Language Model](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/wiki/Language-Models)), as stored in ```/kb```

See also the [main wiki](https://github.com/intersystems/iknow/wiki) for introductions on what to find where.
